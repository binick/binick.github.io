Nothing is done by accident, and this is certainly no exception. The work done is part of a larger context involving the need to migrate a number of ASP.NET MVC 5 applications to ASP.NET Core combined with a desire to make the current architecture more flexible by introducing the concept of modular-programming2.\nWithout getting around too much, the ultimate goal was to measure the feasibility of \u0026ldquo;realizing\u0026rdquo; a micro frontends architecture rendered server-side thanks to Blazor Server.\nIn this regard on Martin Fowler\u0026rsquo;s blog there is a nice article by Cam Jackson in which an overview of this architecture is given and from which I have translated their definition of micro frontends\nAn architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications are composed into a greater whole.\n\u0026ndash; Thoughtworks su martinfowler.com\nI put realize in quotes since the deployment of the various sites would only ever be done in a unified manner.\nPerhaps we would address this issue in a future post.\nNot all donuts come out with a hole. Don\u0026rsquo;t you know what it means? A clear explanation of what this Italian saying means I found in Clozemaster at point 4. Anyway, in two words it means that despite failure there is still something left to eat! Getting straight to the point, the main reason for the failure is related to the inability to give complete autonomy to the teams, for two main distinct reasons.\nHomonymy in support for pages and views Razor. To compose the site each frontends is contained within a Razor class library which also holds the view that is responsible for doing hosting of the Blazor application.\nThis is made possible by the functionality exposed by the SDK that allows a web app to use Razor views, pages, or layouts from class libraries and, as defined in the official documentation, in case of homonymy, precedence is given to the view, page, layout present in the web app.\nIn my case I am in a situation like this\nFigure 1: an ASP.NET Core application referencing two Razor Class Library representing two modules.\nwhere both modules internally make use of layouts contained at the /Pages/Shared/_Layout.cshtml path.\nHere, what would happen in this case is that one of the two teams would be displeased since, if it went well it would see its application rendered inside another layout, in the worst case one part or all of the views would go wrong (e.g., a view tries to enhance a section not declared in the layout). And we note well that both modules executed independently would behave as expected.\nRoutes, the basic route that does not want to work. I have that at least I could not get it to work.\nAgain, following the principle of autonomy, the desired was to separate the module routes from the container routes, for example within Module A we would find / or /index while from the container perspective the routes would be /module-a/ or /module-a/index.\nWhat I found was a \u0026ldquo;short blanket,\u0026rdquo; when internal navigation within the module worked, route generation using Anchor Tag Helper did not work (remember that this spike is the result of a migration process), as I used the middleware UsePathBaseMiddleware for the implementation of the requirement.\nThis resulted in the generation of links within the module to the outside always adding the /module-a at the top of the address even as the link should have simply pointed to the container.\nOtherwise using middleware I would have been forced to use the module name at the top of all @page directives.\nConclusions. Summing up what has been done and reasoning with a cool mind I could say that something good we can still take home, in fact, by not enabling support for Razor pages and views in a RCL3 and avoiding the use of Anchor Tag Helper in the HTML markup that contributes to view rendering we would not run into these problems.\nA spike is a product development method originating from extreme programming that uses the simplest possible program to explore potential solutions.

Within this area there was a very narrow chicane at the exit immediately following a slight descent that followed a long straight. Given the presence of the stream and the permanent shade caused by the trees, it was not uncommon that on some winter mornings there was the presence of ice.\nI never had any accidents there as I was aware of the potential danger and even though the straightaway led to pushing on the accelerator I held back.\nWhat do I want to tell you with this anecdote?\nThat prevention is better than cure?\nNot really, the message is more subtle and is about instinct and consciousness.\nWhat if someone just happened to walk by on one of those mornings?\nAnd maybe even late for his appointment?\nIn all likelihood they would be forced to call the tow truck as they would be unaware of the presence of ice and would step on the brake pedal to reduce their speed on the curve. With consequent loss of grip and a car in the ditch.\nWhat would be the potential consequences?\nLet\u0026rsquo;s assume that after this unfortunate \u0026ldquo;adventure\u0026rdquo; the driver gets out of the car unharmed, what would be the other consequences?\nI would say two, a lightened wallet and a missed appointment.\nA typical approach to OpEx. I guess you are wondering what is the purpose and the reason of this parable.\nYou must know that some time ago I attended some meetings about the migration of a business application for internal use in Azure in which many issues arose due to the permissions assigned to users.\nProblems that have caused the postponement of the production release of a business application for internal use by more than two weeks.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s try, with not exactly little effort, to transpose the parable of the unfortunate driver within this context; we can identify the road as the cloud, the person driving the car as the company. And I\u0026rsquo;d say let\u0026rsquo;s stop there for now.\nTypically when a company approaches the cloud one of the main concerns is cost management1.\nImagine being a member of the security operations team, used to operating on a predetermined set of machines, who now finds himself with a potentially infinite fleet of machines and a warning from his area manager telling him he must contain his expenses.\nThe only thing it knows of that is more like what it has used so far is the role-based access control of Active Directory which finds its counterpart Azure RBAC also configurable from Azure Active Directory.\nWhat would you do? I think I would limit access to all users by giving only the minimum permissions necessary to members of the development team, but I think you would do the same.\nAnd that\u0026rsquo;s what the team did, so they set up two resource groups, one to house all the resources related to networking issues and one for the development team giving them the role of Contributor for the latter.\nSlipping into misuse of resource groups improperly in that some resources such as for example the Azure Kubernetes service relies on a third resource group to host agent pool nodes shared between us and the service itself.\nEducate rather than impose. The SecOps team failed because they were unaware of the meaning of the term Cloud Governance and the tools that Azure offers to support it.\nObviously, the team acted in good faith by trying to limit each team\u0026rsquo;s scope2 of action.\nThinking to achieve two goals: cost control3 and security4.\nHere we now have the necessary elements to resume the transposition begun earlier and identify the ambit2 in the jacke, the release date in the date, and the five disciplines of Cloud Governance in the awareness.\nHere that to try to increase this awareness I created this repository\nbinick / oh-my-azure-playground whose intent is to define standards based on best practices that have emerged in areas such as resource naming, tag management and localization.\nOn which it will then be possible to define patterns for the definition of budget3.\nOver the years I\u0026rsquo;ve started several side projects but never had a post like this one.\nI see this as a first step towards a real commitment, if you would like to elaborate or feel the need to contribute please feel free to contact me üôÇ .\nCapEx vs OpEx in Cloud Computing\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nUnderstand scope for Azure RBAC\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nWhat is Cost Management + Billing?\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nIntroduction to Azure security\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n","permalink":"https://binick.blog/2022/03/29/cloud-governance/","summary":"A few years ago, when I was commuting to work by car, there was a tree-lined stretch of country road along a stream.

Devoted to personal growth and continuous improvement where autonomy and trust are two pillars on which the daily collaboration is based.\nPrologue. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a user of to-do lists, perhaps due to inexperience or perhaps due to some belief unknown to me. The fact is that the systematic failure to follow the shopping list is proof of it \u0026ldquo;Nicola is not able to manage the lists\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce I became aware of this, I started looking for possible patterns and/or methodologies by identifying some that have accompanied me for a couple of months.\nMy inbox is not the email. I realized that what I need is not a list of tasks to do but rather a list of things that I would like to do or that somehow pique my interest. I suspect that on a subconscious level, my brain takes optimistically to the presence of that \u0026ldquo;would like\u0026rdquo; that removes the pressure for things that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there.\nI have three emails, the corporate one and two other historical ones that I\u0026rsquo;ve been carrying around for at least a decade, all three of which follow the philosophy of Inbox Zero by Merlin Mann. I currently flip through them twice a day, roughly before lunch and before the end of the day, these slots are recurring appointments on the calendar until next June 29, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see if they will be extended, but I think so.\nThe rule is very easy:\nit is important and must be executed at a specific time: an appointment is created on the calendar and archived in the corresponding inbox it is important: it ends up in the inbox and archived it interests me: it ends up in the inbox and deleted it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interest me: it ends up in the trash In this way, I always have free inboxes and can keep my attention on those ten or so emails.\nIf an email comes in requesting an active response, I won\u0026rsquo;t run it right away, but like the others, it will follow the rules above.\nOne frog a day is enough. The other enlightening technique for me was the discovery of the 1-3-5 rule1 based on the practice of eating a frog as soon as you wake up2. Obviously not physically, I never want to wake up, and I\u0026rsquo;ve also been getting very little sleep lately!\nSo the day before I make a list of what I\u0026rsquo;d like to do the next day, applying some sort of empirical prioritization of activities of the moment while always making sure there\u0026rsquo;s at least one frog and possibly other filler activities.\nEpilogue. I have to be honest, at first I was skeptical about taking the time to plan my tomorrow. I have to reconsider. The benefits of freeing my brain from the burden of thinking about what to do so that I don\u0026rsquo;t run the risk of losing it forever is something to be reckoned with.\nRight now, the rigidity of the calendar and the flexibility that the 1-3-5 list leaves me with are a good match.

Finally, the technical profile has been added among the technical validation profiles of LocalAccountSignUpWithLogonEmail so that the event is issued only when a user is registered.\nUsing claim transformations. During the creation of custom criteria we could have the necessity to execute calculations, as the number of attempts of authentication, that even if very simple would result impossible without the execution of functions.\nThis requirement finds expressivity through the ClaimsTransformation whose reference of the transformations of the claims contains the complete list of the transformations usable.\nIn the example the methods GetCurrentDateTime and GenerateJson were used\n`` xml The purpose of `GetSystemDateTime` is to enhance the `systemDateTime` claim. `` xml \u0026lt;ClaimsTransformation Id=\u0026#34;GenerateRegistrationEventRequest\u0026#34; TransformationMethod=\u0026#34;GenerateJson\u0026#34;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026#34;objectId\u0026#34; TransformationClaimType=\u0026#34;0.data.objectId\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026#34;objectId\u0026#34; TransformationClaimType=\u0026#34;0.id\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026#34;systemDateTime\u0026#34; TransformationClaimType=\u0026#34;0.eventTime\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026#34;0.dataVersion\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;string\u0026#34; Value=\u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026#34;0.eventType\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;string\u0026#34; Value=\u0026#34;Microsoft.ActiveDirectory\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026#34;0.subject\u0026#34; DataType=\u0026#34;string\u0026#34; Value=\u0026#34;{Settings:Tenant}\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputParameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;OutputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026#34;userRegisterEvent\u0026#34; TransformationClaimType=\u0026#34;outputClaim\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/OutputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ClaimsTransformation\u0026gt; GenerateRegistrationEventRequest has instead the burden of constructing the JSON and enhancing the userRegisterEvent claim.\nConclusions. In this article, we have seen how through Identity Experience Framework it is possible to integrate a B2C tenant with our infrastructure and open possible interesting development scenarios.\nTo do this we touched on Azure Event Grid and how to create an Event Grid Topic.\nFinally how you can manipulate attestations and use them within technical profiles.\nIf you are interested in the complete example you can find it at https://github.com/binick/samples/tree/master/src/enrich-a-jwt-token-with-ief.\n","permalink":"https://binick.blog/2022/01/08/aadb2c-subscribe-to-user-registration-event/","summary":"We will see how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to create a solution that integrates Azure Active Directory B2C to save on Blob Storage dummy data at user registration.\nSolution overview.
