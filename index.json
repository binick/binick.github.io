Devoted to personal growth and continuous improvement where autonomy and trust are two pillars on which the daily collaboration is based.\nPrologue. I\u0026rsquo;ve never been a user of to-do lists, perhaps due to inexperience or perhaps due to some belief unknown to me. The fact is that the systematic failure to follow the shopping list is proof of it \u0026ldquo;Nicola is not able to manage the lists\u0026rdquo;.\nOnce I became aware of this, I started looking for possible patterns and/or methodologies by identifying some that have accompanied me for a couple of months.\nMy inbox is not the email. I realized that what I need is not a list of tasks to do but rather a list of things that I would like to do or that somehow pique my interest. I suspect that on a subconscious level, my brain takes optimistically to the presence of that \u0026ldquo;would like\u0026rdquo; that removes the pressure for things that shouldn\u0026rsquo;t be there.\nI have three emails, the corporate one and two other historical ones that I\u0026rsquo;ve been carrying around for at least a decade, all three of which follow the philosophy of Inbox Zero by Merlin Mann. I currently flip through them twice a day, roughly before lunch and before the end of the day, these slots are recurring appointments on the calendar until next June 29, so we\u0026rsquo;ll see if they will be extended, but I think so.\nThe rule is very easy:\n it is important and must be executed at a specific time: an appointment is created on the calendar and archived in the corresponding inbox it is important: it ends up in the inbox and archived it interests me: it ends up in the inbox and deleted it doesn\u0026rsquo;t interest me: it ends up in the trash  In this way, I always have free inboxes and can keep my attention on those ten or so emails.\nIf an email comes in requesting an active response, I won\u0026rsquo;t run it right away, but like the others, it will follow the rules above.\nOne frog a day is enough. The other enlightening technique for me was the discovery of the 1-3-5 rule1 based on the practice of eating a frog as soon as you wake up2. Obviously not physically, I never want to wake up, and I\u0026rsquo;ve also been getting very little sleep lately!\nSo the day before I make a list of what I\u0026rsquo;d like to do the next day, applying some sort of empirical prioritization of activities of the moment while always making sure there\u0026rsquo;s at least one frog and possibly other filler activities.\nEpilogue. I have to be honest, at first I was skeptical about taking the time to plan my tomorrow. I have to reconsider. The benefits of freeing my brain from the burden of thinking about what to do so that I don\u0026rsquo;t run the risk of losing it forever is something to be reckoned with.\nRight now, the rigidity of the calendar and the flexibility that the 1-3-5 list leaves me with are a good match. Only time will tell if it is a winning choice for me.\n  Why You Never Finish Your To-Do Lists at Work (And How to Change That) by Alex Cavoulacos\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n Eat That Frog: Brian Tracy Explains the Truth About Frogs by Brian Tracy\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n   ","permalink":"https://binick.blog/2022/02/18/daily-milestone/","summary":"I started working in remote mode in March 2020, the reason I guess we all know.\n However, if an extra-terrestrial were to read this post, he can find more information here https://wikipedia.org/wiki/COVID-19.\n My experience has been the same as that of so many others, a maximum and indiscriminate use of communication platforms and smoking ears at the end of the day.\nThis working mode went on for about a year and a half, 16 months to be precise, until July 2021 when I joined managed/designs.","title":"That time I tasted a frog"},{"content":"We will see how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to create a solution that integrates Azure Active Directory B2C to save on Blob Storage dummy data at user registration.\nSolution overview.

In Azure there is an implementation of the publish/subscribe pattern designed to facilitate integration and resource management via an event-driven development paradigm.\nThrough the Event Grid will be possible to subscribe to built-in message sources via a set of handlers.\nIf this is not enough, it is possible to create custom _topics to which you can subscribe to receive events.\nCreating a custom topic. You can refer to this guide to create a topic.\nOne choice to make when creating the topic concerns the scheme of the HTTP request content used. Currently, supported schemas are:\n Event Grid Schema Cloud Event Schema Custom Input Schema this schema will require the creation of an association between the properties of the input object and those required by the Event Grid Schema  The message used in this case has the following structure\n1[ 2 { 3 \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { 4 \u0026#34;objectId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;25100647-****-4571-****-b03e4ce72d02\u0026#34; // unique user identifier 5 }, 6 \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;25100647-****-4571-****-b03e4ce72d02\u0026#34;, // unique message identifier, the same of `data.objectId` in this case 7 \u0026#34;eventType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.ActiveDirectory\u0026#34;, 8 \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;*.onmicrosoft.com\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;dataVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, 10 \u0026#34;metadataVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, 11 \u0026#34;eventTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-12-03T21:04:03.8504745Z\u0026#34;, 12 \u0026#34;topic\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{your-event-grid-topic}\u0026#34; 13 } 14] Issuing the registration event.

Finally, the technical profile has been added among the technical validation profiles of LocalAccountSignUpWithLogonEmail so that the event is issued only when a user is registered.\nUsing claim transformations. During the creation of custom criteria we could have the necessity to execute calculations, as the number of attempts of authentication, that even if very simple would result impossible without the execution of functions.\nThis requirement finds expressivity through the ClaimsTransformation whose reference of the transformations of the claims contains the complete list of the transformations usable.\nIn the example the methods GetCurrentDateTime and GenerateJson were used\n`` xml   \n The purpose of `GetSystemDateTime` is to enhance the `systemDateTime` claim. `` xml \u0026lt;ClaimsTransformation Id=\u0026quot;GenerateRegistrationEventRequest\u0026quot; TransformationMethod=\u0026quot;GenerateJson\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;objectId\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;0.data.objectId\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;objectId\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;0.id\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;systemDateTime\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;0.eventTime\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026quot;0.dataVersion\u0026quot; DataType=\u0026quot;string\u0026quot; Value=\u0026quot;1.0\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026quot;0.eventType\u0026quot; DataType=\u0026quot;string\u0026quot; Value=\u0026quot;Microsoft.ActiveDirectory\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026quot;0.subject\u0026quot; DataType=\u0026quot;string\u0026quot; Value=\u0026quot;{Settings:Tenant}\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputParameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;OutputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;userRegisterEvent\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;outputClaim\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/OutputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ClaimsTransformation\u0026gt; GenerateRegistrationEventRequest has instead the burden of constructing the JSON and enhancing the userRegisterEvent claim.\nConclusions. In this article, we have seen how through Identity Experience Framework it is possible to integrate a B2C tenant with our infrastructure and open possible interesting development scenarios.\nTo do this we touched on Azure Event Grid and how to create an Event Grid Topic.\nFinally how you can manipulate attestations and use them within technical profiles.\nIf you are interested in the complete example you can find it at https://github.com/binick/samples/tree/master/src/enrich-a-jwt-token-with-ief.\n","permalink":"https://binick.blog/2022/01/08/aadb2c-subscribe-to-user-registration-event/","summary":"We will see how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to create a solution that integrates Azure Active Directory B2C to save on Blob Storage dummy data at user registration.\nSolution overview.

Often this happens because we don\u0026rsquo;t have time, other times because despite having written tests we are not able to read the metrics.\n \nSo, how we can \u0026ldquo;humanize\u0026rdquo; code coverage metrics? And how we can generate its?\nTo answer at these questions I usually use two libraries.\n coverlet-coverage / coverlet   to gather metrics, and\n danielpalme / ReportGenerator   for generate human-readable reports.\nHow can set-up coverlet? I usually include coverlet.msbuild by MSBuild .targets Files - Visual Studio | Microsoft Docs.\n For alternative ways to include coverlet into yout test project see also coverlet-coverage/coverlet: Cross platform code coverage for .NET (github.com).\nHow can set-up ReportGenerator? In keeping with above to include ReportGenerator by MSBuild .targets Files - Visual Studio | Microsoft Docs.\n Also this tool offer a various way to use it, you can find all ways onto official documentation ReportGenerator - converts coverage reports generated by coverlet.\nHow to wire-up all that? To make everything work we need to add another MSBuild file.\n And include this into your test project, something like this\n1\u0026lt;Project Sdk=\u0026#34;Microsoft.NET.Sdk\u0026#34;\u0026gt; 2 3 \u0026lt;PropertyGroup\u0026gt; 4 \u0026lt;TargetFramework\u0026gt;net5.0\u0026lt;/TargetFramework\u0026gt; 5 \u0026lt;/PropertyGroup\u0026gt; 6 7 \u0026lt;Import Project=\u0026#34;Tests.targets\u0026#34; /\u0026gt; 8 9\u0026lt;/Project\u0026gt; Now everything you are able to run dotnet test you will able to inspect and analyze something like this\nI think that is an amazing tool to understand at a glance which codes are covered and which not.\nAnd now, how I can put it into Azure DevOps pipeline? It would be nice if this report came was published into the Build pipeline report, don\u0026rsquo;t you think? Maybe even include branch policies for it.\nWell that\u0026rsquo;s possible by use Publish Code Coverage Results task, something like this:\n1- task:PublishCodeCoverageResults@12displayName:Publish Code Coverage Results3inputs:4codeCoverageTool:\u0026#39;cobertura\u0026#39;5summaryFileLocation:\u0026#39;$(Build.SourcesDirectory)/artifacts/TestResults/$(_BuildConfig)/Reports/Summary/Cobertura.xml\u0026#39;6continueOnError:true7condition:always()We notice the summaryFileLocation argument, this means that we will push only one file to Azure DevOps why?\nOne unwrite note of Publish Code Coverage Results task or limitation, I don\u0026rsquo;t know, is that the sum of covered lines, when we publish more reports, is take from the first file This results in an unreliable result.\nTo fix that problem we can marge multiple reports into a summary reports so that can be publish it only one. One way to make it is the follow\n and run MSBuild project into the pipeline with\n1- script:dotnet msbuild SummaryReportGenerator.proj /p:Configuration=$(Configuration)2name:GenerateCodeCoverageSummary3displayName:Generate code coverage summaryOnce you\u0026rsquo;ve done this the sum of covered lines on Build pipeline will true.\n","permalink":"https://binick.blog/2021/01/02/azure-devops-code-coverage/","summary":"By code coverage, we mean the action of trying to measure how much of our code has been executed by our tests.
