[{"content":"In the previous post, we have seen how to enrich a JWT issued by Active Directory B2C with custom policies.\nIn that post, we talked about how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to add information external to Microsoft Graph to a JWT through the use of a Logic App and a Blob Storage.\nInstead, in this one, we will see how it is possible to create a solution that integrates Azure Active Directory B2C.\nFollowing the track of what we covered in the previous post, we will see how to save on Blob Storage dummy data at user registration.\nNote Throughout the rest of the article, there are references to resources and concepts covered in the previous article to which we refer. \nSolution overview. The solution is composed as follows:\n read-customer-details-identity-la: represents the API whose purpose is to retrieve the content of the blob from customersstgacc (the storage account) customer-register-tpc: is the topic in which are collected the events of the creation of a new user customer-identity-details-filler-la: it represents the API that is in charge of generating fictitious data that will be saved inside a blob on the customersstgacc  contoso-b2c: is the access and identity management service offered by Azure  Introduction to Azure Event Grid. In Azure there is an implementation of the publish/subscribe pattern designed to facilitate integration and resource management via an event-driven development paradigm.\nThrough the Event Grid will be possible to subscribe to built-in message sources via a set of handlers.\nIf this is not enough, it is possible to create custom _topics to which you can subscribe to receive events.\nCreating a custom topic. You can refer to this guide to create a topic.\nOne choice to make when creating the topic concerns the scheme of the HTTP request content used. Currently, supported schemas are:\n Event Grid Schema Cloud Event Schema Custom Input Schema this schema will require the creation of an association between the properties of the input object and those required by the Event Grid Schema  The message used in this case has the following structure\n1[ 2 { 3 \u0026#34;data\u0026#34;: { 4 \u0026#34;objectId\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;25100647-0dcc-4571-b7b4-b03e4ce72d02\u0026#34; // unique user identifier 5 }, 6 \u0026#34;id\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;25100647-0dcc-4571-b7b4-b03e4ce72d02\u0026#34;, // unique message identifier, the same of `data.objectId` in this case 7 \u0026#34;eventType\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;Microsoft.ActiveDirectory\u0026#34;, 8 \u0026#34;subject\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;contosob2cqtofmpm.onmicrosoft.com\u0026#34;, 9 \u0026#34;dataVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1.0\u0026#34;, 10 \u0026#34;metadataVersion\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;1\u0026#34;, 11 \u0026#34;eventTime\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;2021-12-03T21:04:03.8504745Z\u0026#34;, 12 \u0026#34;topic\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;/subscriptions/{your-subscription-id}/resourceGroups/{your-resource-group}/providers/Microsoft.EventGrid/topics/{your-event-grid-topic}\u0026#34; 13 } 14] Issuing the registration event.

Finally, the technical profile has been added among the technical validation profiles of LocalAccountSignUpWithLogonEmail so that the event is issued only when a user is registered.\nUsing claim transformations. During the creation of custom criteria we could have the necessity to execute calculations, as the number of attempts of authentication, that even if very simple would result impossible without the execution of functions.\nThis requirement finds expressivity through the ClaimsTransformation whose reference of the transformations of the claims contains the complete list of the transformations usable.\nIn the example the methods GetCurrentDateTime and GenerateJson were used\n`` xml   \n The purpose of `GetSystemDateTime` is to enhance the `systemDateTime` claim. `` xml \u0026lt;ClaimsTransformation Id=\u0026quot;GenerateRegistrationEventRequest\u0026quot; TransformationMethod=\u0026quot;GenerateJson\u0026quot;\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;objectId\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;0.data.objectId\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;objectId\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;0.id\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;systemDateTime\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;0.eventTime\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026quot;0.dataVersion\u0026quot; DataType=\u0026quot;string\u0026quot; Value=\u0026quot;1.0\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026quot;0.eventType\u0026quot; DataType=\u0026quot;string\u0026quot; Value=\u0026quot;Microsoft.ActiveDirectory\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;InputParameter Id=\u0026quot;0.subject\u0026quot; DataType=\u0026quot;string\u0026quot; Value=\u0026quot;{Settings:Tenant}\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/InputParameters\u0026gt; \u0026lt;OutputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;OutputClaim ClaimTypeReferenceId=\u0026quot;userRegisterEvent\u0026quot; TransformationClaimType=\u0026quot;outputClaim\u0026quot; /\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/OutputClaims\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ClaimsTransformation\u0026gt; GenerateRegistrationEventRequest has instead the burden of constructing the JSON and enhancing the userRegisterEvent claim.\nConclusions. In this article, we have seen how through Identity Experience Framework it is possible to integrate a B2C tenant with our infrastructure and open possible interesting development scenarios.\nTo do this we touched on Azure Event Grid and how to create an Event Grid Topic.\nFinally how you can manipulate attestations and use them within technical profiles.\nIf you are interested in the complete example you can find it at https://github.com/binick/samples/tree/master/src/enrich-a-jwt-token-with-ief.\n","permalink":"https://binick.github.io/posts/2022-01-10_aadb2c-subscribe-to-user-registration-event/","summary":"In the previous post, we have seen how to enrich a JWT issued by Active Directory B2C with custom policies.\nIn that post, we talked about how it\u0026rsquo;s possible to add information external to Microsoft Graph to a JWT through the use of a Logic App and a Blob Storage.\nInstead, in this one, we will see how it is possible to create a solution that integrates Azure Active Directory B2C.","title":"Develop integrated solutions with Active Directory B2C and Azure Event Grid."},{"content":"Some time ago I was faced to need to enrich the JSON Web Token issued by Azure Active Directory B2C with information present on an external system.\nTo create this scenario, I leveraged the customization options offered by custom criteria.\nIntroduction to Identity Experience Framework.

Custom criteria represent its expressiveness and allow us, developers, to define the internal flow through a series of one or more markup files.\nHere you can find the About the basics.\nRetrieve Information. In that case, the information was being exposed from a web server exposed behind API Management, for simplicity, I replicated the endpoint with a Logic App. This is its definition:\nAs you can imagine its task is to return the information contained within a blob. In this case, the blob contains the information that will be exposed as JWT claims.\nIn particular, given the objectId which in this case represents the user, a json with this format will be returned:\n1{ 2 \u0026#34;location\u0026#34;: \u0026#34;IT\u0026#34;, 3 \u0026#34;work-teams\u0026#34;: [ 4 \u0026#34;Star\u0026#34;, 5 \u0026#34;Eco\u0026#34; 6 ] 7} Create our custom policy.

I usually include coverlet.msbuild by MSBuild .targets Files - Visual Studio | Microsoft Docs.\n For alternative ways to include coverlet into yout test project see also coverlet-coverage/coverlet: Cross platform code coverage for .NET (github.com).\nHow can set-up ReportGenerator?
