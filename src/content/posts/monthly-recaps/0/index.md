I'm not a writer, I've never been one, and I've known this since my school essays. Every time I passed the column and a half it was a challenge.

Publishing articles on a regular basis takes up a lot of my time, and not just strictly for writing. So I took inspiration from [Troy Hunt](https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/weekly-update/) and thought that creating a monthly summary to update you on my current status and possible future directions might be a good investment of time.

This thing, if I can pursue it over time, will also be useful to me tomorrow.

## Recap 0.

Exactly one month ago today I announced [a new side project]({{< ref "../../azure/cloud-governance" >}} "A new side project"). Well, I managed to create the first [strategy regarding resource naming](https://github.com/binick/oh-my-azure-playground/tree/main/standards/naming) in *Azure*.

The next step is to define the other two strategies, concerning localisation and tagging.

I also plan to create a library in *Python* so that I can integrate it into the *Azure CLI*.
