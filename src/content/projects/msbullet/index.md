MsBullet SDK is a set of MSBuild files that provide common build features of MSBuild SDK distributed through NuGet package.

The pillars on which MsBullet SDK is based are:

### Control and ownership

The developer teams are owners of their repos and they should be feel free to use whatever tools they want.

### Reusability of functionality

Business value is the main goal.
The functionality one team has developed can contribute to another's success.
