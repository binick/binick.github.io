Postal Bird is a company that offers sheetfed and web offset printing services as well as services to support its customers for integrated communication.

The company's decades of experience have been engineered into a software platform by its IT department and other third parties who have implemented satellite parts. All to offer its customers the best possible user experience.

One of the tools offered to customers for the management of integrated communication is represented by a web portal that has been very successful but has begun to show some slowdowns due to the increasing volumes of data managed.
