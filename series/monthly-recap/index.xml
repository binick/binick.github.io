      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m not a writer, I&amp;rsquo;ve never been one, and I&amp;rsquo;ve known this since my school essays. Every time I passed the column and a half it was a challenge.
Publishing articles on a regular basis takes up a lot of my time, and not just strictly for writing. So I took inspiration from Troy Hunt and thought that creating a monthly summary to update you on my current status and possible future directions might be a good investment of time.</description>

<p>Publishing articles on a regular basis takes up a lot of my time, and not just strictly for writing. So I took inspiration from <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/tag/weekly-update/">Troy Hunt</a> and thought that creating a monthly summary to update you on my current status and possible future directions might be a good investment of time.</p>

<p>Exactly one month ago today I announced <a href="https://binick.blog/2022/03/29/cloud-governance/" title="A new side project">a new side project</a>. Well, I managed to create the first <a href="https://github.com/binick/oh-my-azure-playground/tree/main/standards/naming">strategy regarding resource naming</a> in <em>Azure</em>.</p>
<p>The next step is to define the other two strategies, concerning localisation and tagging.</p>
<p>I also plan to create a library in <em>Python</em> so that I can integrate it into the <em>Azure CLI</em>.</p>
